A 2-player Online Tetris Battle Game


Link to working alpha (powered by heroku): https://tetrisparty.herokuapp.com


## Features yet to be added:

1. Share/Join game by direct web link
2. More sound effects (?)
3. Invite to play games at different speed. Maybe also include dynamic speed increase while playing. [MIGHT SKIP]
4. ~~Both players get the same blocks~~
5. ~~Option to ask for a rematch, without having to host and join with a new code~~

## Ambitious Features that would be cool to add, but are likely way too much work:

1. Spectating other games
2. Tournaments
